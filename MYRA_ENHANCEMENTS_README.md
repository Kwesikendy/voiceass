# ü§ñ Myra Voice Assistant - Enhanced Features

## üöÄ New Features Implemented

### 1. Fuzzy Keyword Matching with Clarification
Myra now has intelligent keyword recognition that can:
- **Detect similar words**: If you say "calcu" instead of "calculator", Myra will understand
- **Ask for clarification**: When unsure, Myra will ask "Did you mean 'calculator'?"
- **Learn from context**: Handles typos and mispronunciations better
- **Suggest alternatives**: Provides helpful suggestions when commands aren't recognized

### 2. Improved Session Management
Fixed the issue where Myra would shut down after each command:
- **Continuous listening**: Stays awake for 45 seconds after last activity
- **Timeout warnings**: Warns you 10 seconds before going to sleep
- **Session statistics**: Tracks your usage patterns
- **Extended sessions**: Can extend session time on request

## üìÅ Files Created

1. **`myra_enhanced.py`** - Standalone enhanced version with all features
2. **`myra_fast_enhanced.py`** - Enhanced version based on your fast implementation  
3. **`myra_fuzzy_matcher.py`** - Fuzzy matching utility (can be used standalone)
4. **`myra_session_manager.py`** - Session management system
5. **`MYRA_ENHANCEMENTS_README.md`** - This documentation file

## üõ† How to Use

### Option 1: Run the Enhanced Version
```bash
python myra_fast_enhanced.py
```

### Option 2: Test Individual Components

**Test Fuzzy Matching:**
```bash
python myra_fuzzy_matcher.py
```

**Test Session Manager:**
```bash
python -c "from myra_session_manager import test_session_manager; test_session_manager()"
```

## ‚ú® New Voice Commands

### Session Management Commands
- **"stay awake"** or **"don't sleep"** - Toggle auto-sleep
- **"session info"** or **"how long"** - Get session duration and stats  
- **"extend session"** - Add 60 seconds to current session

### Fuzzy Matching Examples
Myra now understands variations like:
- "calcu" ‚Üí "calculator"
- "notep" ‚Üí "notepad" 
- "browsr" ‚Üí "chrome/browser"
- "volum" ‚Üí "volume"
- "screenshoot" ‚Üí "screenshot"
- "wether" ‚Üí "weather"

## üîß Key Improvements

### 1. Keyword Recognition
- **Threshold-based matching**: Adjustable similarity thresholds
- **Multiple matching types**: Direct, variation, and fuzzy matching
- **Smart clarification**: Only asks when confidence is low
- **Learning capability**: Can add new keywords dynamically

### 2. Session Handling
- **Longer timeout**: 45 seconds instead of immediate shutdown
- **Warning system**: 10-second warning before sleep
- **Activity tracking**: Updates on commands, speech, and interactions
- **Statistics**: Detailed session analytics

### 3. Better Wake Word Detection
- **Fuzzy wake words**: Recognizes "mirror", "maria", "mira" as "myra"
- **Confidence scoring**: Shows similarity percentages
- **Misrecognition handling**: Corrects common speech recognition errors

## üéØ Example Interactions

### Fuzzy Matching in Action
```
User: "Open calcu"
Myra: "Did you mean 'calculator'? I heard 'open calcu' but I'm not sure."
User: "Yes"
Myra: "Great! I'll handle calculator for you. Opening calculator"
```

### Session Management
```
User: "Myra, what's the time?"
Myra: "It's 2:30 PM"
[Continues listening without asking "Anything else?"]

User: [after 35 seconds of silence]
Myra: "I'll go to sleep in 10 seconds if you don't need anything else."

User: "Stay awake"
Myra: "Auto-sleep disabled"
```

## üêõ Fixes Implemented

### Problem 1: Myra shutting down after commands
**Solution**: Implemented continuous session management that:
- Keeps Myra awake for configurable timeout period
- Only sleeps on explicit command or timeout
- Provides warnings before timeout
- Allows session extension

### Problem 2: Poor keyword recognition
**Solution**: Added fuzzy matching system that:
- Recognizes similar-sounding words
- Asks for clarification when unsure
- Suggests alternatives for unrecognized commands
- Learns from user confirmations

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### Session Timeout Settings
```python
# In myra_fast_enhanced.py
session_manager = MyraSessionManager(
    timeout_seconds=45,    # Time before sleep
    warning_seconds=10     # Warning time before timeout
)
```

### Fuzzy Matching Threshold
```python
# In the fuzzy matching functions
matches = fuzzy_matcher.fuzzy_match(command, threshold=0.6)
```

## üîç Testing the Features

### Test Fuzzy Matching
Run the fuzzy matcher in interactive mode and try these examples:
- "open calcu"
- "turn up volum" 
- "take a screenshoot"
- "make screen brighter"

### Test Session Management
1. Wake up Myra
2. Give a command
3. Wait and observe the continuous listening
4. Try session management commands

## üìä Session Statistics

The enhanced version tracks:
- Total wake-ups
- Commands processed per session  
- Total active time
- Average session duration
- Number of timeouts vs manual sleeps

## üöÄ Next Steps

You can now:
1. **Run the enhanced version** to experience both features
2. **Customize the keywords** by modifying the fuzzy matcher
3. **Adjust timeout settings** based on your preferences
4. **Add new commands** using the existing framework

The modular design makes it easy to integrate these features into any of your existing Myra versions or add new capabilities!
